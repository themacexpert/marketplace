## Overview

This smart contract application is an extension of the Truffle Solidity petshop tutorial. I have added additional features and extended the capability of the original program.

### How to Run
To run the program, you can use a locally running blockchain on Ganache. In your first terminal window, use command npm run dev to start the web interface. In a second terminal window you can run the commands "truffle develop" and then simply "migrate." My application uses hard-coded Ethereum testnet addresses, which you can change to addresses running locally on your machine should you prefer.
